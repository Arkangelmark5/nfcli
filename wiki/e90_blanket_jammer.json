  "ComponentName": "E90 'Blanket' Jammer",
  "LongDescription": "The E90 'Blanket' overwhelms its target by barrage jamming, primarily targeting radar frequencies typically used by most military radar suites. The result makes the victim warship unable to detect its own radar returns. Also effective on missiles and point-defense, but vulnerable to home-on-jam missiles.",
  "FlavorText": "If there's anything that we can't be beat at, it's EWAR and ELINT, mostly the former. Space is big and there's not much in the way for cover unless you're hiding in a gas cloud, rock field, or sitting in a star corona like a moron but the Naval Office needed something to hide our fleets and that revelation came in the lack of EWAR expertise seen in our enemies.\n\nObviously, it's not as subtle as a 'Hangup' jammer, but it works damn fine when it comes to flooding the target with radar contacts. Using these on incoming missiles is also viable, just pair it up with a couple of chaff cans and you're good to go.\n\nThe downside is that Blankets in combat duty need to have a cooldown period to prevent the emitters from frying themselves, unless the crew puts the warship into battleshort condition, but at that point it's usually an emergency. Overall, there might be other systems out there that can match the Blanket, but none that can out-do it.\n\n- I. Parker. CMC",
