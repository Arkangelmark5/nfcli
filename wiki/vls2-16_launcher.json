  "ComponentName": "VLS2-16 Launcher",
  "LongDescription": "Available to nearly all warships, the VLS2-16 is the most common missile platform found in the fleets, with a generous 16 cells that allow for a mix-and-match mission profile of all medium-size missiles, such as the SGM series of cruise missiles. Despite the ease-of-use, reloading the cells is a delicate task that can only be completed in port, so once a VLS is empty, it's useless for the remainder of an engagement.",
  "FlavorText": "A weapon that predates interstellar flight itself. In my opinion, you're looking at a tried-and-true design here, and I'd gather it'll continue to service the fleets for many campaigns to come. It's a bread-and-butter weapon system for the Alliance fleet and performance-wise, it's as simple as it looks.\n\nSeasoned crewmembers will tell you otherwise, though. A Raines given a couple of these will wind up FFG (if you catch my drift) because of the force projection these can give to a warship, and life on a missile frigate is regarded as anything but glamorous.\n\nStill, you can't beat the classics, and I think the Naval Office agrees, grumbling crewmen be damned.\n\n- T. Meadows, LT",
