  "ShortDescription": "Turreted Missile Launcher",
  "LongDescription": "What the Protectorate lacks in advanced missile technology, it makes up for in volume.  These rocket launchers are just a series of tubes banded together with an ignition circuit run through them but up close, where they can't miss, their damage rivals that of even a particle beam.",
  "FlavorText": "TO: OTDEL\nFROM: NOVANCE\n\nSince you pencil-pushers don't like to share design specs with me despite giving you the biggest contribution to your navy since Harper, I went behind the Department's back and snagged the RL18 schematics from Cass. As you are no doubt aware, my crew has some damn fine engineers and you bet I'm going to put them to work on giving us some more bang for our silver. Cass did a great job but we need more tubes if we want to really outgun the Alliance VLS, so that's what I'm giving you.\n\nWe managed to keep weight under control and swapped out Cass' triggers with B-V Industries quad-triggers from mining charges, it works wonders. It's a little more pricey but that's a small price to pay for having more rockets in our back pocket, so I'm going to present it to Constantine later. You wouldn't say no to Constantine, right?",
