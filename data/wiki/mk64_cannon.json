  "ComponentName": "Mk64 Cannon",
  "Faction": "Stock/Alliance",
  "ShortDescription": "Class 3 Cannon",
  "LongDescription": "A medium-weight cannon, intended to operate as a middle-ground between the lighter and heavier Mk.6x series, offering excellent firepower to shred light warships while also providing a solid punch on targets above its weight class. \n\nWith a fairly quick acquisition time, the weapon can reliably train onto heavier targets, but will struggle against smaller, more evasive targets. As such, it is best used from medium-to-long range where its ample reload time and accuracy can best be used. Fires 250mm chemical-ballistic shells.",
  "FlavorText": "The Graznovian Conflict made it pretty clear to the Naval Office that we needed something between the light and heavy guns, Novians were running circles around the assault fleets and the big 450s just couldn't keep up. The 60 and 61s were just too lightweight to apply proper pressure on targets, we were falling behind. Towards the end of the Conflict, the War Office brought in a couple design specs to the Naval Office, just all smug and chewing on cigars, tapping away at the readouts in a \"we'll do your job for you\" kind of way.\n\nNaval Office didn't like that very much and finally took some initiative to come up with the Mk64, parking what's basically an oversized howitzer on a heavy chassis. Recipe for disaster, absolutely, but it turned out to be the best damn general-purpose gun to land in the Admiralty's lap and the Brass was impressed. Once Constantine took over the ANO, I read that he made his own taskforce hover around in front of the War Office head during a visit at Bradford, each loaded with Mk64 guns.\n\n- T. Meadows, LT",
