  "Faction": "Stock/Alliance",
  "ShortDescription": "Fusion Drive",
  "LongDescription": "A high-power drive designed for long-distance cruising.  Significantly increases the ship's top speed, as well as its ability to maintain flank speed without damage, but at the expense of maneuverability.",
  "FlavorText": "Codenamed 'Whiplash', probably because the engines will make the entire ship jolt and send crewmen all over the deck when Helm sets it to full burn. The Naval Office liked the idea of applying some of the Sprinter's speed to the larger warships, and so does the Lee Helm when they hit a full ahead bell.\n\nOverall, Whiplash drives are an Alliance favorite, until the engine room is filled with the drive grinding and the Chief Engineer is going off on one of their legendary litanies of swearing. It's a real treat.\n\n- I. Parker, CMC",
