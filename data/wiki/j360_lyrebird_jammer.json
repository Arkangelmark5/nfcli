  "ComponentName": "J360 'Lyrebird' Jammer",
  "SaveKey": "Stock/J360 Jammer",
  "Faction": "Stock/Protectorate",
  "ShortDescription": "Jammer (Radar)",
  "LongDescription": "The J360 creates an omnidirectional swept jamming signal, on frequencies typically used by military radar suites.  It can be used to cover a large group of ships against missiles using any kind of radar homing, but its omnidirectional nature means the jamming signal at any given point is weaker than that of a directional jammer.",
  "FlavorText": "TO: NOVANCE\nFROM: COMMAND ENGINEERING - SCT-K\n\nVance, we've received the Otdel's word that you're cleared for deployment of the 'Lyrebird' jammer, I think you'll like this one. Expect to be put into dock on your return to Pyxis since we'll be installing the system straight onto your lineship following inspection. We've built it off a DeLeanu 'Vulture', so it'll be a quick installation job that shouldn't take more than a few days to program and test, you'll be back out in the Black in no time.\n\nUnlike the Bellbird, we're using pulse jamming for this one with an option for cover pulse techniques should you so choose. Bulwark did a run-through of the emitters and utilized a modified version of their Huntress transmitters to keep the device efficient and robust, it's some fantastic work all around. As far as I'm aware, this was a proposed project in the Alliance Naval Office that was slated for test development but the project lead bailed and ran off with the schematics to our side, so you can be damn certain the Alliance won't be happy when we're using this on them. By the way, DO NOT PAINT ANYTHING ON IT, I'm tired of having to get chewed out by the technicians every time you return to port.",
