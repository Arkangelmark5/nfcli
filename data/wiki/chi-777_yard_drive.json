  "FlavorText": "TO: KURITA OSPN-LINK\nFROM: NOVANCE\n\nHey, Ben, thanks for the help with getting these installed. I couldn't get Amelie to budge and Constantine has more important things to do, so I thought I might as well go ahead with it. To be frank, the Longhaul drives just don't cut it anymore, I can't have my lineships aimlessly floating around to get picked off by a Mace or something. I think these drives from Cain Heavies should really help out, we're using the modified 700-series- you know, the ones with the re-routed fuel lines? I asked the driveworks if they could get us some better manifolds to go in there too and, I gotta say, they delivered cus' the performance increase is wild. I'm going to grab some techs later and throw them in the drive room to squeeze out some more performance, so I'll keep you updated on that.\n\nThank the stars we're using these freighters for our frontlines, the modularity is a lifesaver. Makes me wonder what the other captains are using, you know? We don't have mil-spec drives but some of these civvie drives gives those AN systems a run for their money.",
