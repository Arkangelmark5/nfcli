  "ComponentName": "C60 Cannon",
  "SaveKey": "Stock/C60 Cannon",
  "Faction": "Stock/Protectorate",
  "ShortDescription": "Class 2 Casemate Cannon",
  "LongDescription": "With stockpiles of 450mm shells filling Alliance supply depots across Protectorate space, it was only natural that they would be procured for use in the Bethel Blockade.  The C60 is meant to provide a heavy punch-up capability to the smaller commandeered ships which can't mount the larger C65.  In hunter-killer packs, this weapon can completely devastate an Alliance ship caught unprepared.",
  "FlavorText": "TO: LOGICOM\nFROM: CKEYS\n\nI don't know what you guys are pulling out of the Eight Ball Belt, but the metallurgy on this thing is impressive, we've put it through the usual stress tests for atmo, cold-vac, and zero-g, everything holds up better than the Alliance's 6X series. There isn't much I can improve upon here but I did ask Alexander to try and fit a modified recoil cylinder on- which wasn't an easy feat, let me tell you. We had to cut down the barrel length and change out the breech to a rotating drum, which is more efficient on space usage but I've seen hands get crushed in the mechanism far too many times.\n\nI still recommend only manning this with your most experienced crewmen, the firing pressure the shells put out can knock the alignment way off and you'll need to spend a good amount of time making sure that it gets back on target. I don't know what you'll be able to fit the whole gun system on since this takes up some room even with the modified recoil brace, but it should fit your usual bulker. By the way, heard there were some rumblings over in Kribensis and something about plasma, you know anything about that?",
