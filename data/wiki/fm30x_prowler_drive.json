  "Faction": "Stock/Alliance",
  "ShortDescription": "Fusion Drive",
  "LongDescription": "By removing most of the high-power components and reflective drive housing, this drive greatly reduces the warship's radar signature at the cost of a significant decrease in speed and reduced drive durability.",
  "FlavorText": "You don't usually see these, at least not on frontline warships. From what I found in the old Naval Office documents, these were supplied to a line of now-mothballed Raines variants that haunted the Eight Ball Belt to weed out the pirate problem. Evidently, that worked out pretty well.\n\nBut the actual engine crew will give you a look if you so much as think about complimenting the drive. Since the Naval Office took off the protective housing, a good shake will make the entire drive switch into a shutdown state and blare the loudest alarm you've ever heard. I definitely don't miss working on these.\n\n- I. Parker, CMC",
