  "ShortDescription": "Jammer (Radar)",
  "LongDescription": "The J15 is a simple directional swept noise jammer, designed to radiate radio waves in frequency ranges typically used by military radar suites.",
  "FlavorText": "TO: NOVANCE\nFROM: COMMAND ENGINEERING - SCT-K\n\nWe've received authorization from the Otdel to issue you the first units of the J15, I believe you refer to it as the 'Bellbird'. For your information, this is built off a BLU-Wall PJS/72, so you should be able to do your usual maneuvers through asteroids without worrying about the frame getting scuffed, it's built to last. With some help from Bulwark, we also managed to up the output using transmitters of Venuman design that we manufactured from a datasafe a defector brought over. In short, you'll be using DRFM jamming to 'capture' your target's radar and change it into false contacts and tests have already shown it to outperform the Alliance's E90 in signal strength. However, we had to cut back on the cooling because of expenses and time constraints, it can only run for roughly half of the Blanket's duration and should only be used when you're initiating an attack.\n\nAlso, it should go without saying but I know you like to bend protocol: DO NOT ALLOW CREW TO PERFORM EVA REPAIRS WHEN THE DEVICE IS ACTIVE. I shouldn't have to explain to you the dangers of allowing a human being to get a sweep of overjuiced radio waves, we've all seen what happens to the birds on Pyxis.",
