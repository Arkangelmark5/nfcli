  "ShortDescription": "Damage Control",
  "LongDescription": "Damage Control lockers provide a warship with teams capable of repairing ship components and restoring destroyed modules or compartments back into working order.\n\nEach locker allows a certain number of restorations for destroyed modules or components, but destruction of a DC locker will completely remove all available restorations. This compartment is reinforced to make it more likely restorations will remain available after a big hit.",
  "FlavorText": "Nobody messes with the damage controlmen or their tools. When the ship starts taking fire and pipes are bursting open, everybody gets out of the way when the rattling of tools and heavy boots storm down the passageways.\n\nOutside of combat, the hatches to the lockers tend to remain closed, giving the lockers an aura of mystery that ensigns are always wanting to peek into, especially when there's loud clanging and inaudible shouting coming from behind it. Best not to look too deep into it, there's talk they perform demonic rituals in there.\n\n- I. Parker, CMC",
