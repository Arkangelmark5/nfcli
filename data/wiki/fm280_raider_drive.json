  "ShortDescription": "Fusion Drive",
  "LongDescription": "A highly modified drive commonly found on scouting or quick response warships. This drive is designed to channel all of its generated output into the thruster nozzles to provide high acceleration and maneuverability.  However, this additional thrust increases wear on the thrusters significantly while travelling at flank speed.  Due to the small size of this drive, and the diversion of all generated power to maneuvering, this drive does not provide any grid power output.",
  "FlavorText": "Engineers nicknamed these 'Raider' drives since you'd usually find these on pirate corvettes with a worrying number of questionable modifications by the crew. I've only worked on a few of these in my career, but it's not uncommon to find even the military variants lined with jury-rigged repairs, something the Brass warns (but is powerless to stop) as a 'very dangerous practice'.\n\nDoesn't stop the maintenance crews, though. Hell, it didn't stop me either. When you start running out of parts, the idea of a little DIY repair becomes pretty tempting.\n\n- I. Parker, CMC",
