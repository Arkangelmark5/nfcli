  "ShortDescription": "Mine Launcher",
  "LongDescription": "Minefields serve as an excellent force multiplier, something the Protectorate is in desperate need of.  The ML-9 is capable of launching 5 mines in rapid succession before it needs to be reloaded.  When used alone or in pairs it can rapidly create a dense minefield which will delay the advance of any enemy warships.",
  "FlavorText": "AN-STELLARCOM//EKOTA BOUY 06-VVV-4\nXX: IDENT: LT. MEADOWS\n\nAll captains, heads up: Protectorate's getting very bold because we just took a blow from a spiker contact in an empty sector during patrol. Damage and casualties minimal (frag wounds, mild hull breach)- the fuze was delayed, but if it worked properly, you'd be looking at a dead ship instead of a buoy. Report already sent to ANO but for those curious, Ordnance EVA'd the chassis and can't determine make or manufacturer, either it's an ancient design not in the databanks or it's custom-made which is some real [EXPLETIVE REMOVED, OBEY PROTOCOL].\n\nLast time we dealt with mines was back in Deshima and STABLE was not too pleased with us (and the Collective) leaving them all over the place, so I have to wonder what's different with the OSP that the Commission isn't getting on their [EXPLETIVE REMOVED, OBEY PROTOCOL] about loitering weapons.",
