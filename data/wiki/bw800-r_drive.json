  "FlavorText": "The battle was over but the Slayer Grip was not without its injuries. Moreau moved into the drivebay, shifting out of the way of passing damage controlmen hauling kits of hull-patches and shoring, their sweat rolling off their faces into free-floating globules in the zero-G environment. His boots hit the deck with a muffled thump and, slowly, he worked his way to the drive unit parked in the center of the compartment. Brushing away globes of refrigerant and jostled tools, Moreau's heart sank as he neared the radial control and immediately spotted the fist-sized hole through the driveline housing. A trail of scorched shrapnel left an obvious sign of weapons fire, a bridge from a sealed hull-breach to the housing.\n\nThe BW800 was never designed for this kind of punishment, frontline duty was a job for the bigger models. Moreau's hand brushed across his beard and he peered into the hole, expecting to see the manifold as nothing but a mangle of metal- but as he looked towards the powerline, he spotted a faint, blue light shimmering in the dark. He shone his pen light into the channel and smiled. Wedged into an armored block bearing the symbol of a tower was a shard of blackened shrapnel, its edges still glowing from heat. He judged that 3 more inches to the right at the converter and the whole drive manifold would have exploded. His light moved downwards, reading the words printed beneath the symbol:\n\n\"Manufactured by Bulwark Heavy. Armor unit hand-inspected by Abel Drake - Property of the Protectorate Navy\"",
