  "ComponentName": "ES22 'Pinard' Electronic Support Module",
  "LongDescription": "The 'Pinard' Electronic Support Module allows a host warship to detect radar signatures well beyond its maximum radar range in the form of ELINT signals, displaying a rough line of bearing towards the detected emitter. Two ships with ES modules will produce a crossfix track, showing the rough position of the emitter.  The accuracy of this crossfix improves as the angular separation between the sensors increases.\n\nThe Pinard can only see signals in the hemisphere above it, so two modules on opposite sides of a ship are required for full coverage.",
  "FlavorText": "The ES22 is actually a repurposed survey system we pulled from a Walker-class Explorer. The Naval Office found that the same principles of scanning distant stellar signals could also be used in the detection of radar waves after simple tuning to match the appropriate search radar bands utilized by modern military suites.\n\nStellar debris loves these, attracts shrapnel and rocks like Alliance Marines to a case of cheap beer, even the OSP know that just the smallest nick on one of the receivers will knock this thing out of alignment and waste about a good hour or two of repair and testing. Servicing one of these is a serious test of patience and the Naval Office won't let you forget that.\n\n- I. Parker, CMC",
