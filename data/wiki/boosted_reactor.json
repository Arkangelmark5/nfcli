  "LongDescription": "This reactor has had its power output boosted by making unauthorized modifications and removing many safety features.  It provides more power, but has a much higher probability of catastrophic failure under fire.",
  "FlavorText": "BLACK SANDS RELAY-55-9M\nAUTHORIZED COMMUNICATION\nT: OSPN BLAZE OF GLORY SHIPLINK\nF: VICTOR BAILES\n\nThis is Bailes, CTO of Southstar Insight, sending a message to Captain Holland Lamoreaux. I hope this reaches you as this is my fifth attempt to contact you while you're docked in Black Sands and I am somewhat frustrated. It has recently come to my attention that, after a contracted civilian inspection of a Southstar MRB-200 ship reactor by the Protectorate 'Otdel', your crew has seemingly performed unchecked work with your reactor unit and disabled the magnetic limiter attached to the tokamak. This is incredibly dangerous and immediately voids any warranty we provide. I understand that one of your fusion reactor officers has stated that they have over 11 years of experience with a reactor of this model, but that is not an excuse to perform such dangerous modifications to your reactor.\n\nI do not know who is responsible for this but I strongly advise that you re-enable the limiter and submit the crewman responsible to whatever punishment the Protectorate Navy uses for firing individuals. While, yes, removing the limiter will give a substantial increase to output, you are also subjecting the interior ring to an increased magnetic field strength and a possible increase to what your officer described as a 'reactor bloom'. I attempted to explain this to your reactor crew but was immediately rebuffed, insulted, and repeatedly called a 'tie-wearing groundhog'. I have already logged a complaint with a very nice lady named Amelie in the Protectorate Navy and she vowed to get to the bottom of this when she is able.",
