  "Description": "The 350 Mace is a command-guided, impact-detonated torpedo with a slow flight speed and poor maneuverability. Furthermore, the launching ship must maintain a track on the target for the entire flight time, otherwise the Mace will not guide itself to the target.\n\nThe Mace has a very large payload and is extremely deadly on capital-class warships and can make short work of even the heaviest of armored warships should a salvo connect.\r\n\nSize: 3\nCruise Speed: 130 m/s\nRange: 3,120 m\n\n<b>Warhead:</b>\nType: Explosive Impact\nArmor Penetration: 200 cm\nComponent Damage: 5000 hp\nBlast Angle: 100\n\n<b>Seeker:</b>\nType: Command Guided\nSupports TRPs: No",
