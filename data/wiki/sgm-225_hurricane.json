  "MunitionName": "SGM-225 Hurricane",
  "Description": "The Hurricane is a Command-Guided cruise missile which is steered onto its target by the launching ship, and can even correct its path back on the target after a miss.  However, because a target is selected directly, these missiles cannot be sent on waypoint paths to find occluded targets.  Furthermore, the launching ship must maintain a track on the target for the entire flight time.\n\nSize: 2\nCruise Speed: 200 m/s\nRange: 14,000 m\n\n<b>Warhead:</b>\nType: Explosive Impact\nArmor Penetration: 150 cm\nComponent Damage: 1200 hp\nBlast Angle: 70\n\n<b>Seeker:</b>\nType: Command Guided\nSupports TRPs: No",
