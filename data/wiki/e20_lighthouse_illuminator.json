  "ComponentName": "E20 'Lighthouse' Illuminator",
  "Faction": "Stock/Protectorate",
  "ShortDescription": "Illuminator (Radar)",
  "LongDescription": "A radar transmitter that deploys a high-power cone in a direction for the purpose of guiding semi-active missiles.  A side-effect of this is the boosting of the target's radar signature, making the target easier to see.",
  "FlavorText": "TO: NOVANCE\nFROM: OTDEL\n\nVance, your request for radar illumination equipment is granted but we cannot provide you with a device capable of 'hacking every Alliance VLS to launch missiles at Winchester's home' at this time and we would prefer it if you maintained a level of professionalism in the future. Otdel leadership has been in need of a testbed for a illumination device and we have determined that you are the best fit. We understand you are loathe to work with the folks at Shibuya- however, Keystone has come into acquisition of an Alliance station key and transferred it to us, revealing a distro-station stashed with a variety of Alliance equipment, notably the E20 'Lighthouse'.\n\nWe are currently struggling to produce our own illuminator and believe that the Lighthouse, while an older model and noticeably obsolete, will suffice for the time being. Your scheduled return to port will see your warship equipped with a Lighthouse device and you will be instructed in its usage. Please show in a timely manner, your habit of taking 'detours' around the station is not appreciated.",
