  "LongDescription": "This compartment converts a large cargo bay space into a storage and organization area for spare parts and casualty control equipment.  It does not provide facilities to outfit damage control teams, but when combined with a traditional DC Locker it can help bring even the most crippled ship back into the fight.",
  "FlavorText": "IDENT: CMC. IRONS, PARKER\nDAGGER-COMET DEPT-COMM.\n\nI need you guys to do a thorough check of the aft DC compartment, there's a brawl going down over in Ekota and we're about to pass through the Gate. I need a report before we exit hyperspace transit but I've got a box of Moky's Smokey donuts for the team that can get it to me before that. Aft storage should have the expanded number of shores and latch connectors that we've been given, check with your team leaders for the inventory list attached to your assigned DC locker.\n\nPlease watch your step, I don't need someone tripping on a shore and busting their ass. Also, if you need to take anything, LOG IT ON YOUR WRISTCOMP. I am tired of someone taking my crescent wrenches or splinter kits without informing me or the DCA, you guys have no idea what it feels like when someone borrows tools and just ghosts on the ship while I'm running around looking for the 12\"",
