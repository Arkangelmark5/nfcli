  "ShortDescription": "Size 2 Missile Launcher",
  "LongDescription": "The MLS-2 is a roll-off missile launcher, loaded by crew members who retrieve munitions from bulk magazines. The MLS-2 can fire a volley of 4 medium-size missiles, like the SGM-series, before requiring a reload. As the reloading process is complicated, the MLS is restricted to firing currently loaded missiles, while swapping missiles requires a complete reload.\n\nThe MLS-2 comes with a special built-in system to initialize and pre-warm missiles during the loading process, skipping the lengthy pre-launch initializations and checks of an always-ready system like VLS.  This enables missiles to be launched immediately upon order, only taking a moment to load the target parameters before firing.\n\nNOTE: Rolloff-style launchers are not capable of firing defensive missiles.",
  "FlavorText": "BETHEL RELAY-30-7E\nGLACIER-CRYPT ENABLED\nT: CKEYS L7-LINK\nF: EMPEROR REVERSE\n\nKeystone, I'm attaching an access key to the arsenal lockup sitting over near Eontria, don't lose it. Constantine wants to convert the hoard of MLS-2 launchers into equipment we can apply to our own warships. Turns out the Alliance mothballed all of these during their whole 'standardization' phase and just stashed them away in all their distro-stations. Free game, right?\n\nWe've already got a few units pulled from the lockups nearby and they're working wonders, but I'd appreciate it if you could look into cutting down on all the moving parts so we can fit it to a tugboat or something. I've been on a couple security cutters and I can't recall how many times I've seen guys crush their hands in the loader systems. Don't really want that to happen to us, you feel me?",
