  "FlavorText": "There's various ways to combat comms jamming, aside from the simple solution of destroying the jamming source. Other solutions involve \"talking louder\" than the jamming frequency but the typical counter is to simply fire a high-power optical beam at the intended target.\n\nOSP EWAR tends to favor \"deafening\" warships to cut them off from sentries. The Naval Office's solution was to install impedance jumping to \"shift\" out of a jammed frequency, but this is only effective if the threat is attacking a specific frequency, so the Office decided to try broad-spectrum which the OSP responded by attacking every possible radio frequency.\n\nFalke said it best: moves and countermoves. A never-ending game of who can talk over who.\n\n- S. Ace, CWO",
