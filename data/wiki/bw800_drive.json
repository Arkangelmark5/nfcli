  "FlavorText": "-- Sartore Shipyard - Worklog N80-44093 - Ship: Tyrannical Gaze\r\n// SUPER - Alexis Withrow\r\n// Initial Assessment - BW800 'Steel Bolt' Drive\n\r\r\n1. Cursory inspection of the unit shows good maintenance but someone clearly tampered with the manifold to output more power than necessary. The host vessel is a shuttle-type ship and the minimum power output of the Steel Bolt is more than enough to provide adequate thrust and power to all maneuvering systems. Would love to know what was going through the person's head who attempted this.\r\n2. Spoke with drive officer, questioned removal of heat shunts. Supervisor was handed canvas bag of channel shunts removed from regenerative cooling jacket. Supervisor was informed that the Steel Bolt operates at a higher working temperature stated otherwise and can output far more than working output. Informed drive officer that, while true, the sacrifice in housing integrity is a valid concern. Supervisor was told \"don't worry about it.\"\r\n3. Supervisor investigated rattling sound from driveline housing during thrust calibration. Found inner channel lined with Silver. Assistant engineer informed Supervisor that coinage served as \"excellent\" liner to prevent scoring from high output thrust and hexagonal form factor of coins made driveline channel sturdier and \"richer\". Supervisor deems this as a dumb joke and suggests reprimand for appropriate personnel. Removal of channel shunts did show a large increase in power and drive integrity remained completely stable, if not improved.\r\n\nConclusion: Begrudgingly, inspection passed. Additions to drive structure unwarranted but undoubtedly considered improvements. I hate this job.",
