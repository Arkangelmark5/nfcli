  "MunitionName": "SGM-206 Thunderhead",
  "Description": "The workhorse of Alliance missile weapons. Highly versatile and can either be directly launched at detected tracks or, using the guidance systems, steered using waypoints to initiate surprise attacks on targets, allowing the missile to find its own targets.\n\nUpon reaching the final waypoint, the Thunderhead will activate its on-board radar system and actively guide itself into the nearest target. However, the missile cannot turn back should it lose the target, and is easily defeated by radar-disruption.\n\nSize: 2\nCruise Speed: 200 m/s\nRange: 14,000 m\n\n<b>Warhead:</b>\nType: Explosive Impact\nArmor Penetration: 150 cm\nComponent Damage: 1200 hp\nBlast Angle: 70\n\n<b>Seeker:</b>\nType: Active - <color=#4CFF72>RADAR</color>\nRange: 2,000 m\nFOV: 50 deg\nGain: 25 dB\nPower: 150 kW\nSupports TRPs: Yes",
