I'm sending a malfunction log that keeps tripping when Helm sets the drive to full burn. Each time they hit the bell, the entire radial shakes more than a Graznovian Forboda- it's loud, dangerous, and any further stress is going to send it flying around the drive bay before taking someone's head off. I've had Group 1 and Group 2 pour over all the mounting points and my assistant is struggling to find any way to improve on it, so I was hoping to get your advice on it.\n\n\nPersonally speaking here, I don't know why the hell Bulwark insists on using these drives from Vogt-Jager, Schtiel makes better drives than this. I appreciate them taking the time to pump out some more thrust power and cutting down on the weight, but there's a reason why modern-day bulkers carry those big efficiency drives and not these 'high-power' units.\n\n\nI hope they don't monitor these Comm-Points...",
