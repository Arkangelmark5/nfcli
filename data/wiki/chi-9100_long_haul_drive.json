  "ComponentName": "CHI-9100 Long Haul Drive",
  "Faction": "Stock/Protectorate",
  "ShortDescription": "Fusion Drive",
  "LongDescription": " A heavy civilian drive designed for cargo vessels making long, direct trips.  Greatly increases thrust power and top speed while reducing turning rate.",
  "FlavorText": "OSPN EMPEROR REVERSE\nXX WRISTCOMP DIRECT-COMM XX\n-- Recorded Transcription - Report edited\n\n- CAPT N. Vance: What's going on down there? Why have we stopped moving?\n- LT B. Stratis: The drive entered a shutdown state and we couldn't override it in time. Looks like Cain Heavies implemented an automatic cut-off when the charger starts to draw too much power.\n- N. Vance: Is this the main drive or one of the backups?\n- B. Stratis: The 9100 Long Haul. I'm looking over the auto-report right now and it seems that the MEC is designed to immediately kill the power when it detects too much drive power being diverted to the maneuver units. I think it's supposed to operate in lockstep with a Superbrain to prevent that but I also think Cain didn't account for our latest model of DARCBrains and it completely killed the RAM banks.\n- N. Vance: Can you repair it?\n- B. Stratis: Simple fix. We'll need to check the EIU and sensors but we've got a stack of additional units in the cargo.\n- N. Vance: Get it done. Replace the RAM, do a core dump, send it off to Command Engineering. We'll drive a straight course as much as possible. Leave it to Cain to make everything difficult.\n- B. Stratis: Tell me about it.",
