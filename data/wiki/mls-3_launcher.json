  "ComponentName": "MLS-3 Launcher",
  "LongDescription": "A roll-off launcher capable of firing heavy anti-ship munitions, typically torpedoes. The MLS-3 is manually loaded by crewmembers pulling ammunition from the bulk magazines and can fire 3 torpedoes per volley. As the ammunition is quite heavy, the MLS-3 has an extensive reload time and is restricted to firing only the currently loaded weapons.",
  "FlavorText": "You'll find these on Sprinter-classes and nothing gets the hands shaking than when you hear the metallic clang of a torpedo rolling off the rack and hitting the deck because of newbies who underestimated the strength you'd need to move Mace torpedoes around.\n\nFor a time, we used to export these fitted with permanent safety locks to colonial flotillas to keep them from loading high-grade munitions, but of course, pirates found that they could just saw off the brackets and adapt their own missiles to fit in the slots. In response, the Alliance pulled every MLS-3 off of most colonial fleets, restricted them to military use, and upgraded them to launch not one but three torpedoes. Honestly, like most Alliance military developments, the civilians always get the short end of the stick.\n\n- T. Meadows, LT",
