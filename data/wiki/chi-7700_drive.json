  "ShortDescription": "Fusion Drive",
  "LongDescription": "A high-maneuverability drive commonly found on bulk haulers traveling in and out of dense asteroid fields, transporting mining yields to refineries elsewhere in the system.",
  "FlavorText": "I understand that you have a variety of vessels under you that utilize the 7700-A drives, Constantine. As a sign of good will for our continued partnership, I'm authorizing a transfer of additional parts to convert them into the 7700-B series that should be far easier for your crews to maintain and will serve as a better fit on your lineships than the usual 777. These are streamlined and will be as easy as replacing a few parts, a task that should only take some days to test and complete.\n\nI do not expect anything in return but should you wish to provide something to me, I've learned that you were particularly close to the CEO of Falke-Tethys, that being Autumns. Of course, I am sure that you may have some insight into the operations of the Driveworks and of Autumns herself, insight that would be incredibly beneficial to myself and the further development of technology for the Protectorate. Maybe we can discuss this on your return to Black Sands? I know an excellent restaurant in the capital.\n\n. . Cain",
