  "ComponentName": "ES32 'Scryer' Missile ID System",
  "LongDescription": "The ES32 is a missile defense and support system which uses a mixture of dedicated sensors placed around the hull, as well as the warship's own integrated radar panels, to determine the capabilities of incoming missiles in order to defend against them.  Capabilities of identified missiles will be automatically tagged to the threat's sensor track.  Additionally, the Scryer can directly integrate with the point defense control systems of the host warship to determine what decoys need to be fired in order to counter a given threat, prevent waste of limited resources.",
  "FlavorText": "I was actually in the room when the Naval Office engineer in charge of this system was proposing it to Winchester and I don't think I'll ever really forget the look on his face. The Parallax was a wildly successful project for the Alliance but, as with most things from the Naval Office, the sheer development costs and manufacturing troubles meant that the Parallax is a 'what you see is what you get' kind of project. It was actually supposed to have the Thirty-Two as base functionality but by the time that was thought up, the Parallax was already way over-budget and Winchester was not having any more precious funds wasted on development.\n\n\nInstead, it turned into a module that can be attached to *any* radar suite after Vice Admiral Hauer shouted loud enough to drive Winchester mad, so he ordered some engineers to rush it through development and forced it past the Naval Office's design committee. Arguably, any incoming missile should be destroyed regardless of its type, but it turned out that smart point-defense programming was more efficient than just 'launch everything', which is nuts, this thing is a lifesaver.\n\n\n- I.
