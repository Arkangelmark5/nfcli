  "LongDescription": "Damage Control lockers provide a warship with teams capable of repairing ship components and restoring destroyed modules or compartments back into working order.\n\nThis type of locker contains a single team of elite damage control personnel who can quickly move to a damaged component, assess its condition, and execute emergency repairs.  They work more quickly than normal DC teams, but they don't have the tools to perform restorations of destroyed components.",
  "FlavorText": "Carrying your tools around during an engagement while sprinting through passageways takes serious strength, take it from me. I've hauled shoring from deck-to-deck while taking fire (and returning it) from boarding teams, but that was only one time and I would never want to do it again. Damage Control is a skill in and of itself and it's one that the Brass will gladly drill into everybody's minds when atmosphere begins to vent and your job gets harder when you're in clunky vac-suits.\n\nThe solution to that is rapid DC teams, personnel who are the best of the best when it comes down to it, years of experience under their toolbelts and they specialize in authorized \"rapid gundecking\". In exchange for speed, they drop a lot of the heavy tools and atmo-plates for lighter loads, so don't expect them to be able to fully restore something from a disabled condition. Is that a glass-half-full or a glass-half-empty situation? Really, it's neither. We're engineers. It means the glass was manufactured to the wrong specifications.\n\n- I. Parker, CMC",
