  "ComponentName": "Rapid DC Locker",
  "LongDescription": "Damage Control lockers provide a warship with teams capable of repairing ship components and restoring destroyed modules or compartments back into working order.\n\nThis type of locker contains a single team of elite damage control personnel who can quickly move to a damaged component, assess its condition, and execute emergency repairs.  They work more quickly than normal DC teams, but they don't have the tools to perform restorations of destroyed components.",
  "FlavorText": "These guys are the best of the best when it comes to repair. They have years of experience under their toolbelts and they specialize in what they've come to classify as \"blast maintainence\", which is a fancy phrase for authorized gundecking, except they actually know what they're doing and won't blow the ship up.\n\nSince they don't have the parts or tools to restore destroyed equipment, they'll usually leave it to the regular damage controlmen to run by and finish their work, which you can probably guess what the latter thinks of that.\n\n- I.
