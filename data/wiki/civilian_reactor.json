  "FlavorText": "OSPN ULTRAMAX\nGUNWROUGHT COMM-POINT\nT: LASSEN\nF: FUROC-AUSTIN\n\nYour 8'o'clock report, Lieutenant Lassen, as usual. We haven't had any trouble with the new reactor from Deckard, in fact, they run better than we expected, a lot better than the Vogt-Jager FRs Command Engineering threw us. There's no equipment troubles, ANORS, and tools are all accounted for, just Carlisle dropped a bolt in the tokamak and it made a pretty loud rattling sound that made the whole reactor team flip out during prep. We managed to get a pretty nice jolt of extra power out of the reactor without any sacrifice to efficiency, I've attached the worklist of what we did in the message report.\n\nI still think we should up-armor the housing so any hits from rocks or, I don't know, a Tempest missile won't make the whole thing rattle because as nice as these are, the frame's a little on the loose side. Military or not, these things can still bloom and I don't want to be twiddling my thumbs while an Alliance Sprinter crew is laughing all the way back to port when they see the hull start to glow from the reactor going crazy.",
