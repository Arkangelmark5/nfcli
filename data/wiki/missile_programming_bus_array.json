  "ShortDescription": "Missile Support",
  "LongDescription": "Programming targets and flight paths into missiles is a complex process, and only one missile can be programmed at a time on most ships.  This module upgrades the missile programming bus to add additional programming channels, enabling more missiles to be prepared for launch at the same time.",
  "FlavorText": "Personally speaking, I think this is more of an asset suited for Parker's skills rather than myself, but my duties do tend to fall under missile control systems when the Brass has need of it. See my report on the Parallel Interface and you should see the benefits of allowing more missiles to be prepared alongside reduced launch times. Rather than allow missiles to sit in their cells waiting for their 'turn', the improved bus allows the Superbrain to program fire missions in tandem, dividing the actual data-work into individual 'packets' that are then delivered straight to the missile's flight computer, instead of relying on an uninterrupted data-stream.\n\n\nA valuable asset for any modern warship, absolutely, but it leaves the Naval Office with a bad taste in their mouth considering the enormous costs to upgrade the entire naval arm. Try as hard as Vice Admiral Heikkinen might, the Naval Office will never do a fleet-wide refit.\n\n\n- S. Ace, CWO",
