  "FlavorText": "OSPN EMPEROR REVERSE\nINTERSHIP COMM-POINT\nT: NOVANCE\nF: FUROC-SHADI\n\nCaptain, my team has finished the initial assessment you requested. Speaking plainly, these Vogt-Jager reactors might as well be a bargain bin special, there's no way this'll power the whole ship unless we turn off everything except the mess sink, we'd be lucky to get lighting running. I think you knew that already but I thought I'd give you my opinion on it.\n\nFor a lineship, it's a nice backup of power but Vogt-Jager clearly engineered this for something like a yacht or a ferryship even though they marketed it for freighterwork which, looking at the injector system, would make this thing buckle in on itself before you could even have reactor control start warm-up. The housing is efficient but the power cycle is needlessly wasteful and I think that's a result of Vogt-Jager trying to take the whole 'light' aspect a little too far. Reaction quality is alright but the reactors from the Naval Office are still the standard when it comes to stability, just wish they had the tokamaks from Bulwark. I think, given how much Silver you have to shell out for one of these, it's a decent choice if all your ships are nothing but civilian-converted warships... funny, right?",
